        We believe in weddings without the cheese.  We believe in music as expression that connects us together.  It’s brought each of us from different walks of life to make up the family we have in Blue Ave Groove today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like anything we do, we strive to not go through the motions but give you part of us in each song.  We’re building a better version of what it means to be a “wedding band” filled with music from the soul bringing friends and family together for the experience of a lifetime.
